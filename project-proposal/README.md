1. **Present the problem statement.** <br/><br/>
People have a need to know the weather for planning their day-to-day activities. Without having an easy to access weather application, they likely will not understand what may happen later in that day regarding the weather. This information can be extremely beneficial for planning events, organizing work sites, and arranging outdoor activities. Some major components of the application will include the ability to customize the user’s profile, easy access to up-to-date weather information on the go, and alerts/notifications for people when there are dangerous weather conditions/phenomena (air quality, thunderstorms, hail…). <br/>

2. **Explain who the intended user is. It can be you or a fictitious entity you will represent.** <br/><br/>
We intend the users of this application to be a wide range of people such as the general public, business owners, or event planners. With something as impactful as the weather, anyone who has any plans that rely on the condition of the weather would be able to find a practical use for the application.

3. **Describe why the user has this problem.** <br/><br/>
The user does not have knowledge of the weather for now or for the future, they are not sure on how to plan around the weather without being given the relevant information. When you are making plans, depending on what you want to do, the weather can vastly expand or limit your options and it is nice to know about it. Also, it is helpful to dress based on the weather throughout the day so that you are not unprepared or uncomfortable.

4. **Describe how a solution would benefit the user.** <br/><br/>
The user can utilize the information to help properly make plans by expecting weather events and circumstances. For example, knowing that it may rain today may alter the plans of someone who wants to go on a hike. Business owners could use the app to be able to organize how their workers will operate (i.e. if it was to rain, they might want to have their employees work inside or vice versa). Event planners could also have a similar use application, where they can change event dates or venues based upon the forecasted weather.


5. **Describe the general flow for addressing the problem. The existing (or imagined) flow does not have to involve a computation solution.** <br/><br/>

7. **What is the general nature of the solution? For example, app, standalone program, website, plug-in.** <br/><br/>
We are leaning towards a building a mobile application as it feels more aligned to the project’s goals. We plan on using a plethora of available services such as a weather API (Weatherbit.io, Openweathermap...), a frontend service such as Vue, and a backend service such as Firebase/PHP. User feedback could also be utilized to help with the accuracy of our app. 

8. **List the general software components you envision playing a role. For example, web server, database, game engine.** <br/><br/>
We will be utilizing a database that holds users’ account information such as their search history and “favorites” locations together with user profile, and we will also be using webservers (for both the frontend and for the backend).

9. **List the general hardware components you envision playing a role. For example, drone, VR headset, tablet. You are responsible for your own hardware, so be reasonable.**	<br/><br/>
Our general hardware components will be smartphones and tablets, essentially any mobile devices that a user would bring with them when they are on the go.

**Challenges and Risks:
What is the single most serious challenge you see in developing the product on schedule? How will you minimize or mitigate the risk?** <br/><br/>
We foresee there being several challenges, such as learning JavaScript and implementing a Vue based frontend as a mobile application. We plan on mitigating it by properly scoping out what needs to be done, separating the workload into reasonable sized projects in a viable time scale, and ensuring that we are all fully aware of both the individual/team goals and objectives that need to be accomplished.
