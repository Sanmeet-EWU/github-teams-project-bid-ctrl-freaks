**Additional Remarks/Inputs** <br>
Please tell us about any other factors that we should take into consideration (e.g., if you really would like to work on a project for some particularly convincing reason). <br><br>
Our reasons for wanting to work on a weather app would be that we could add a good amount of features. As well as have enough time to complete the app to our liking, making sure everything runs well, and make sure the software is reliable. <hr>
